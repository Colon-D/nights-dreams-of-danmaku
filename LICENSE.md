Pretty much everything by me is under [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt), with some minor exceptions I guess.

`danmaku.png` was modified from [Assets Free Laser Bullets Pack 2020](https://opengameart.org/content/assets-free-laser-bullets-pack-2020) by [Wenrexa](https://opengameart.org/users/wenrexa) which is under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

I have no clue what the original source of `scream.ogg` is.

Some small code sections are from places like StackOverflow.
I've tried to credit them in the code, as that seems more reasonable than here.

Nights is owned by whoever owns Nights... blah blah blah.
Anything else I've not credited is stolen. I hate licenses.
